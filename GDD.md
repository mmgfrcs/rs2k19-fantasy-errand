## Abstract
In this fantasy world of magic, a young apprentice alchemist called Amane Kisora is running an errand from her master to look for a certain ingredient for alchemy purposes in a seemingly harmless dungeon. However, during this errand, she doesn't know that the place she was told to look into is a house to a very fearsome beast.

And thus, she ran away from the beast.

## Base Game Mechanics
Fantasy Errand is a 3D Endless Running game with AR control, where the player controls the character in first person using motion. The goal of the game is to run as far as possible. Score is calculated based on how far the player runs in one game and how much coins the player take on one run.

The game will also feature dynamic balancing, which uses facial emotion recognition technology to enhance user experience satisfaction in the game. In principle, the game will ease out if the player is in distress and toughen up if the player is happy or bored.
